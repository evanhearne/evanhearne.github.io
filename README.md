| Project Description | BetterTFI is an open-source approach to navigating public transport using a cross platform mobile app. Its main aims, from survey results, is to have minimal and easy to use features that allow the app to be performant when the user needs to navigate public transportation. It utilises Flutter as the mobile app development framework, and Go/Docker for API management. <br><br>The NTA (National Transport Authority) has published their API for [GTFSR](https://gtfs.org/documentation/overview/) (General Transit Feed Specification - Realtime) and Vehicles, but is limited to 5,000 requests per day from a default developer API key. Therefore, a custom backend which utilises the 5,000 requests per day will allow the app to still query for data without limits.<br><br> As it currently stands, there is no open source implementation of a navigation app for Ireland. This means there is a gap in the market to fill, where users or developers may appreciate seeing the source code of an application users may rely on to help them navigate their journey using public transport. |
